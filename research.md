## Natural Language Processing & Conversational AI

My research focuses on building practical task-oriented dialogue systems . Working with Professor Larry Birnbaum, I aim to improve the reliability and effectiveness of conversational AI by enhancing the semantic capabilities of LLMs and their ability to handle natural and goal-driven conversations.  

Key methods include:
- Commonsense reasoning and pragmatics  
- Synthetic data generation for fine-tuning  
- Language model agents 
- Hybrid architectures that communicate task and domain constraints to an LLM  

## AI for Cardiology
At the **Northwestern Medicine Center for Artificial Intelligence at the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute (BCVI)**, we focus on leveraging artificial intelligence to advance cardiology, with a particular emphasis on heart failure. Our research aims to enhance patient care through the following areas:  

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Clinical Text:** Adapting NLP for use in the clinical domain, including information extraction, classification, streamlining clinical trials, and managing guideline-based medication therapies.  
- **Risk Prediction Models for Heart Failure:** Developing and validating predictive models to identify heart failure subtypes and associated risks.  
- **AI-Driven Echocardiogram Analysis:** Automating echocardiogram analysis with AI, including piloting Ultromics EchoGo Core at BCVI to streamline measurements and support accurate cardiovascular diagnosis.  

**Example Projects:**  
- Predicting heart failure subtypes using large language models (LLMs) and validating these models with external datasets.  
- Utilizing NLP to build structured datasets from diverse clinical text sources, including biopsy reports, imaging reports, and longitudinal data.  
- Diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis from medical imaging data using AI.  
- Predicting the risk of cardiac amyloidosis from both text and structured longitudinal data.  
- Developing de-identification tools for patient data, including anonymizing DICOM images and text from clinical notes.
