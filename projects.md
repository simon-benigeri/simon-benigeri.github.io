# Personal Projects


- [CalendarBot](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/calendar-bot/): A RAG chatbot for calendar event retrieval, using a hybrid approach (date-based and vector-based retrieval). It runs on Google Gemini and can be set up to work with your Google Calendar data.
- [LearningToAsk](https://github.com/c-col/LearningToAsk/): We tested LLM planning and reasoning capabilities by playing 20 questions, leveraging datasets from prior work by [Mazzaccara et. al 2024 - EMNLP](https://github.com/dmazzaccara/LearningToAsk): We developed a custom backend to simulate the game, measuring LLM performance (win percentage, turns per win, information gain per question). To enhance reasoning, we applied test-time scaling using the budget forcing technique from the paper [S1: Simple test-time scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393).
- [NU-NLP: Evaluating Summarizers](https://github.com/nu-nlp/evaluating-summarizers): A framework to train and evaluate neural abstractive (BART, Pegasus, T5) and optimization based summarizers (e.g. TextRank) on a variety of datasets. This code supported the experiments for the paper [Multi-domain Summarization from Leaderboards to Practice: Re-examining Automatic and Human Evaluation (Demeter et al. 2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.gem-1.20/).
- [Listening to elephants](https://www.fruitpunch.ai/blog/listening-to-the-giants-protecting-forest-elephants-through-audio-monitoring): Collaborated with [FruitPunch.ai](https://www.fruitpunch.ai/) to train and deploy models detecting elephant rumbles and gunshots from rainforest audio. We focused on translating a research project to the real-world, optimizing audio processing and inference, and deploying deep learning models on edge devices.
- [Dope Image Classifier](https://github.com/kobe-org/dope-image-classifier): An ML engineering project on image classification (CIFAR-10) using tools like PyTorch Lightning, Optuna, Weights & Biases, RedisAI, ONNX, and Streamlit.
- [Deep Q Trading Agent](https://github.com/lukesalamone/deep-q-trading-agent): A project using deep reinforcement learning to trade stocks from  past data. 
- [LSTM Language Model](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/lstm-language-model): Built and trained a word-level language model with LSTM on Wikitext-2 and NY Times Covid-19 articles. Explored hyperparameter effects like dropout and embedding tying.
- [Low Precision Machine Learning](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/low_precision_ml): Experimented with quantization error and stochastic rounding using low-precision floating-point representations.
